# Last_Pencil
This is the study project from Hyperskill academy which teaches to create a game where some number of players should one-by-one to pick up wether 
1, 2 or 3 pencils from the stack. The player who should pick up the last pencil looses the game.

Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable. 
Invite a friend to play the Last Pencil, a game where you decide who wins. 
In this project, your opponent is a computer that is an expert in the game. But it's up to you to choose who wins.
